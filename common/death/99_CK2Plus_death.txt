# Don't forget to add new deaths to the scripted death triggers
# Frames can be specified for individual death reason, using "icon = 2" or similar. Defaults to 1 if not specified
# Only the first frame gets recolored based on illness/known killer
# Use "killer_icon = 2" or similar to have a different icon shown if there's a known killer. It'll default to using whatever you specified with "icon" otherwise
# The icons themselves are defined in GFX_overlay_char_dead and GFX_overlay_char_dead_small
# sound = no will prevent this death reason from playing a death sound
# death_date_desc will define a different loc key than the default "DEATH_DATE_DESC" to use for descriptions of their date of death. E.G., to use "Went to China: $DATE|Y$ at age $AGE|Y$" instead of describing them as having died
# can_nokiller = yes will cause it to have different localisation if there's a killer defined together with the death_reason or not. If there's no killer defined then it will look for the localisation key of "<long_desc>_NO_KILLER"
